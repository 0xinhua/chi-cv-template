Rip-off of [Alex Chi Zhang (cxs/skyzh)](https://github.com/skyzh)'s [CV](https://skyzh.github.io/files/cv.pdf) as a LaTeX template called `chicv`.

Suggestions and PRs are welcome. Honestly, I'm not a master in LaTeX.

照着迟先生的简历扒的模板。祝大家都能成功得令人震惊。

## To-Dos

### Basics

- [x] Font set-ups (esp. local font config)
- [ ] Local fontawesome set-up
- [x] Skill list environment (label-free bullet list with proper indentation)
- [x] Basic info list environment (list-like environment, straight line sepearted items listed on the same line)
- [x] "Updated on YYYY/MM/DD" footer
- [x] Refine hyperlink style (underlined, sufficient vspace -- no overlap w/ chars)
- [ ] Makefile and stuff

### Chores

- [ ] Instructions on how to compile
- [ ] Intro to custom environments and commands
- [ ] (Probably) publish to CTAN as a proper `.cls`.

### Additional ideas

I personally need a academic curriculum vitae.

- [ ] Publication list
- [ ] TBD
