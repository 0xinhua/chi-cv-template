\section{Education}
\cventry{Carnegie Mellon University}
  {August 2022(Expected) -- December 2023 (Expected)}
  [Master of Science in Computer Science]
  [Pittsburgh, PA]
\cventry{Shanghai Jiao Tong University}
  {September 2018 -- June 2022}
  [B.Eng in Computer Science and Technology]
  [Shanghai, China]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item GPA 93.58/100, Rank 1/149, National Scholarship 2019 (Top 0.2\% national-wide)
    \item A+ Courses: Operating Systems, Computer Architecture, Computer Networks, and 28 others
  \end{itemize}

\section{Internship Experience}

\cventry{Singularity Data, Inc.}
  {August 2021 – July 2022}
  [Database System R\&D Intern]
  [Shanghai, China]

\begin{itemize}
  \item One of the top contributors of RisingWave — a next-generation streaming database in the cloud. \\ Worked on the development of almost all components related to stream computing and state store.
  \item Designed and implemented \textbf{shared state} to support \textbf{streaming index} in RisingWave; implemented \textbf{lookup join executor} based on shared state to support efficient \textbf{index delta joins}.
  \item Lead the team to investigate and analyze performance issues in RisingWave with benchmarks; fixed bugs and proposed strategies which improved the system throughput by 10x in a 3-month period.
  \item Greatly improved RisingWave’s development experience by initiating the developer ecosystem, including streaming system dashboard, developers’ tool RiseDev, and a benchmark set-up tool based on Terraform. They are now indispensable parts of everyone’s development process.
\end{itemize}

\cventry{ByteDance, Ltd.}
  {June 2021 – August 2021}
  [Storage System R\&D Intern, TerarkDB Team]
  [Beijing, China]

\begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented \textbf{Zone-Aware Garbage Collection} in \textbf{TerrakDB} for Zoned Namespace SSDs, which reduced 3-4x of space amplification caused by interleaving write lifetime in a single ZNS zone. % TODO: github link
  \item Added observability facilities to \textbf{ZenFS} (by Western Digital) to analyze bottlenecks and implemented a \textbf{WAL-Aware Zone Allocator}, which reduced the p999 tail latency by 100x. % TODO: github link
\end{itemize}

\cventry{PingCAP, Inc.}
  {August 2020 -- January 2021}
  [Sotrage System R\&D Intern, TiKV Storage Team][Shanghai, China]
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Built LSM-based storage engine \textbf{AgateDB} from ground-up. Inspired by WiscKey and BadgerDB, AgateDB separates large vallues from LSM tree into value log, so as to reduce write amplification.
  \end{itemize}
